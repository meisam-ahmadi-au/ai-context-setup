# Project Specification Example

This is an example of how to write a project specification that the AI can use with this template.

## Project Goal

Create a simple todo application with the following features:

### Core Features

1. Add new todo items
2. Mark items as complete/incomplete
3. Delete todo items
4. Filter items (all, active, completed)
5. Clear all completed items

### Technical Requirements

- Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (vanilla JS)
- Store data in localStorage
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Accessible (keyboard navigation, screen reader friendly)

### User Interface

- Input field at the top for new todos
- List of todos with checkboxes
- Filter buttons at the bottom
- Item counter showing active items

### Acceptance Criteria

- Users can add todos by typing and pressing Enter
- Clicking checkbox toggles completion status
- Delete button (X) removes items
- Filter buttons show appropriate items
- Data persists between browser sessions
- Works on mobile devices
- Passes basic accessibility tests

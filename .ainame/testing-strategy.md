# Testing Strategy

## Default Requirements:

- Each feature must have corresponding tests
- All tests must pass before marking subtask complete
- Maintain existing test coverage levels

## Test Types (customize as needed):

- [ ] Unit tests
- [ ] Integration tests
- [ ] End-to-end tests
- [ ] Performance tests
- [ ] Security tests

## Coverage Requirements:

- Minimum coverage: [TO BE DEFINED]
- Critical paths: 100% coverage required

## Testing Framework:

[TO BE DEFINED - e.g., Jest, PyTest, etc.]

## Test Organization:

- Tests should be co-located with source code or in dedicated test directories
- Test files should follow naming convention: `*.test.*` or `*_test.*`
- Each module/component should have corresponding test file

## Test Categories:

### Unit Tests:

- Test individual functions/methods in isolation
- Mock external dependencies
- Fast execution (< 1 second per test)

### Integration Tests:

- Test interaction between components
- Use real dependencies where possible
- Test API endpoints and database interactions

### End-to-End Tests:

- Test complete user workflows
- Use real browser/environment
- Cover critical user journeys

## Testing Notes:

[Add project-specific testing requirements here]

## Continuous Testing:

- Run tests before each commit
- All tests must pass in CI/CD pipeline
- Failed tests block deployment
